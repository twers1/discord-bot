# Discord Bot

## Description

a Discord bot crafted with Python! This bot offers a unique set of features, including moderation tools and music playback using the youtube_dl library. My bot aims to provide a quality and diverse experience for your Discord server.

## Features

### Moderation
Discord Bot includes a set of powerful tools for moderating your server. Manage members, maintain order, and ensure safety with ease.

### Music
Enjoy an excellent musical experience with my bot. The music module, based on youtube_dl, allows you to easily play music from YouTube. And that's just the beginning! In the future, I plan to expand support to platforms like Spotify to offer you even more options for musical diversity.

### Future Plans
 Discord Bot is constantly evolving, and I have exciting plans to add many more features. Get ready for:

- Enhanced music support with Spotify
- Database integration for saving user settings
- Engaging game modules for diversity
- And other cool stuff!

2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Create the configuration file `.env` and add your tokens and settings.

That's it! Your Discord Bot is now ready to work on your Discord server.
